# Cyberbullying Sentiment Analysis Project: 316-final-semester-project

Welcome to the Cyberbullying Sentiment Analysis project repository! This repository contains code, data, and resources related to sentiment analysis on cyberbullying tweets using Naive Bayes and BERT models for my DCIT 316 - Computational Methods for Social Media Mining Final semester project


## Project Overview

This project aims to develop and evaluate sentiment analysis models for cyberbullying tweets. We employ both Naive Bayes and BERT models to classify sentiments in cyberbullying tweets based on attributes such as religion, age, ethnicity, gender, and non-bullying sentiments.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cyberbullying-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd cyberbullying-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/cyberbullying-classification and place it in the `root` directory.

2. Specify the path to the dataset in the code
3. Run the code 

Happy coding! 🚀
